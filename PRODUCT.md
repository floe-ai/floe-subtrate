# Floe Product Contract

This document defines the intended human experience of Floe. It does not prescribe internal architecture.

## The product

The operator tells Floe what they want to happen.

Floe determines what organisation, actors, capabilities, contexts, tools, and continuing work are required. It forms and evolves that system using the substrate.

The operator should not need to understand how Floe is implemented in order to use it.

## Operator contract

The operator may say:

- what they want;
- what they expected;
- what confused them;
- what feels wrong;
- what they want changed;
- what they approve or reject;
- what only they can decide or do.

The operator should not be required to:

- design actor topology;
- design workflows or graphs;
- wire events;
- choose contexts;
- create substrate structures as setup work;
- understand routing or delivery;
- choose a substrate solution to a product problem.

There is no Default Scope that the operator must understand or manage. Scopes are optional substrate organisation when the work actually needs them.

## Floe's responsibility

Given an outcome, Floe should:

1. understand enough of the desired result to attempt it;
2. inspect available capabilities and relevant workspace state;
3. compose what already exists before requesting new machinery;
4. form the organisation required to pursue the outcome;
5. start useful work;
6. continue across time and interruptions;
7. adapt the organisation when reality requires it;
8. keep the operator sufficiently informed to trust and redirect the work;
9. ask for human involvement only when it is valuable.

Floe should not ask the operator to solve implementation questions that Floe or its development system can resolve by inspecting, testing, or experimenting.

## Capability discovery

Floe is not expected to preload every implementation detail.

When a real outcome exposes a missing capability, Floe should first discover what is already available. It may inspect tools, workspace state, runtime capabilities, canonical documentation, and accepted extension contracts for a concrete reason.

Extensions are one possible way to add capability, not the default answer to every problem.

If an outcome requires a capability that Floe cannot currently create, install, enable, or use, that is a product failure to surface clearly. It is not a request for the operator to design the missing substrate mechanism.

## floe-app

`floe-app` is the preferred human operator surface, but the existing application is not automatically the product specification.

The default operator path should be simple:

**open a workspace → talk to Floe about an outcome → see meaningful consequences and references → intervene when useful**

The operator interface should show the organisation Floe has created and the state that matters to the operator. It should not default to an inventory of substrate primitives.

Existing views that enumerate or configure Scopes, Actors, Contexts, runtime details, activity, or substrate settings may remain useful as a developer/debugging observatory. Their existence does not make them part of the default operator experience.

Do not extend those observatory surfaces merely because a new substrate capability exists.

Do not create a requirement that every substrate capability must have a human UI.

Do not require the operator to browse the substrate to discover whether work is healthy.

## Legibility

The operator needs situational awareness, not omniscience.

Floe should make it possible to understand:

- what outcome it is pursuing;
- what organisation it formed;
- what meaningful work is happening;
- what changed;
- what is blocked;
- what needs human judgement;
- why an important decision or action occurred.

When connected work is still active, the operator must be able to stop it from
the same work surface. Stopping is durable: queued work, active model or command
turns, folder sources, and scheduled pulses for that operation do not resume on
restart. Its history remains available so stopping work does not erase what
happened.

The appropriate representation should be discovered through use. It may be conversation, summaries, references, notifications, generated surfaces, or other forms.

No universal visualisation architecture is assumed.

## Self-describing representation

Prefer a substrate whose objects, relationships, references, state, and available actions are self-describing enough that clients can provide a safe generic representation without bespoke UI code for each concept.

A generic representation is a fallback for legibility and inspection, not a mandate to place every substrate concept in front of the operator.

When a human need requires a richer surface, Floe may compose a purpose-specific projection or lens from the same underlying shapes. Bespoke coded UI should be reserved for cases where generic or declarative representation cannot express the required interaction or meaning.

This is a design pressure, not a roadmap item. Build it only when real operator experience proves where generic interpretation is insufficient.

## Progressive disclosure

Normal autonomous work should be quiet.

More detail should become available when the operator asks, follows a reference, investigates a problem, or needs to build trust.

Deep substrate telemetry belongs behind deliberate inspection, not in the normal product path.

When real use exposes a problem, the operator should be able to create a local support report from the affected conversation. Floe may contribute a tentative semantic explanation, while system facts come from authoritative supported APIs. The operator sees the exact redacted report before saving or sharing it; Floe does not transmit the report automatically. Reproduction should begin in an isolated workspace when replay could create persistent unwanted state, external effects, or material token use.

## Product development

Product needs are discovered from real use.

A user observation such as "I cannot tell what happened" is evidence of a legibility problem. It is not an instruction to build a universal visualiser.

A user observation such as "I expected this to continue" is evidence of a continuity failure. It is not an instruction to add a particular scheduler.

Diagnose the experience first. Build the smallest general correction. Then return the product to the operator.
