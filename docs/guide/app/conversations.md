# Conversations in floe-app

**A [[Context]] opens as a conversation: a message list, who is currently working, and who you are speaking as.**

## Opening a conversation

The normal **Conversations** entry lists Contexts in which the workspace operator participates. Workspace entry selects the latest Floe conversation inside this same surface; Floe is not a separate route. Opening any item names the other participant, fixes the speaking identity to the operator, and provides the same back, new, and delete actions. Developer tools can also open a conversation from a scope's Contexts tab, an actor's Conversations tab, or Activity; that form shows the context label and participant pills (see [[Navigating floe-app]]).

## The message list

The body is a scrollable, chronological stream. Only events of `type === "message"` render as chat bubbles — lifecycle bookkeeping (like a context being created) is hidden from the stream by default. Each bubble shows the author's resolved name and a timestamp; the author is looked up from the [[Endpoint]] id on the event, never shown as a raw id if a name is available. The list auto-scrolls to the bottom as new messages arrive, but stops sticking if you scroll up to read history.

## Speaking as

There is no human identity in floe — the substrate has no human/agent distinction, and peers cannot tell what backs an [[Actor]]. So the composer does not ask who *you* are; it asks which [[Actor]] you want to post as, via a "Speaking as" selector. Sending a message posts it into the context as that actor's [[Endpoint]].

Normal operator conversations fix the speaking endpoint to the workspace operator and show the workspace provider, model, and reasoning effort above the composer. The composer remains disabled until a connected provider and model are saved, so an operator cannot create a message that a model-backed collaborator is not configured to handle. Developer-opened conversations keep the general "Speaking as" behaviour.

## Joining a context

The "Speaking as" selector stays visible even if the actor you have selected is not a [[Context|Participant]] of this context yet. A "Join context" button lets you add that actor as a participant before you send. Participation is membership, not a subscription to being woken — joining does not by itself make the actor respond to anything; it only makes it able to emit and be seen as present.

## Seeing who is working

A "`<actor> is working…`" indicator appears while an actor has a live [[Delivery and Turn|Delivery]] or turn in progress in this context. It is driven by the same bridge↔bus WebSocket the substrate uses for everything else — there is no polling.

The bottom of the main navigation shows the health of Floe's local services and model runtime. Green means both are connected, amber means the app is reconnecting or waiting for the model runtime, and red means work cannot continue. Open the status for the failure detail and, for a stopped packaged runtime, a **Restart local services** action. If the runtime stops during a visible turn, the conversation replaces the stale working indicator with an explicit interruption notice; it does not imply that work is still progressing in the dark.

## Reporting a Floe problem

Every normal operator conversation has **Report a problem**. The report asks for expected behaviour, actual behaviour, impact, a tentative classification, and the safe boundary for reproducing the problem. Floe's latest reply is offered as an editable tentative interpretation; it is not treated as a system fact. When the operator asks Floe to report a problem in conversation, Floe can emit the same semantic draft and the message shows **Report ready — Review**. Floe still cannot collect authoritative diagnostics or save the report without operator review.

The app then requests one bounded diagnostic envelope from the Bus for that Context: public recent Events, related delivery state and safe operational runtime telemetry, sanitized participant identities, runtime liveness, and current capability identifiers. The Bus omits tool arguments, tool output, visible-output duplication, and scratch reasoning at the diagnostic API boundary. The app then redacts sensitive keys, credential patterns, user-home paths, URL credentials, and email addresses before showing the exact Markdown and versioned JSON export.

Nothing is sent automatically. After exact preview and explicit approval, the app writes `report.md` and `report.json` beneath `.floe/state/feedback/REPORT_ID/`, records the report in the workspace's **Floe reports** list, and marks it **Not shared**. **Copy handoff** produces a direct instruction containing the exact report path for a local developer agent. If replay could create durable unwanted state or material token use, the report directs verification through an isolated workspace first. An actual development connection remains optional and is not implied by saving locally.

## Creating a new context

In normal Conversations, **New conversation** starts another Context with the currently selected collaborator; **New with Floe** starts one from the list. No Context is created until the operator submits the first outcome. Developer tools can also create contexts from a scope or actor view. A created context can optionally belong to a [[Scope]]; one with no scope still exists. If the operator is a participant, it is reachable from normal Conversations; otherwise it remains available through Developer tools.

## Implementation

- `floe-app/src/scope/ContextConversation.tsx` — conversation view, message stream, Speaking-as selector, Join context, working indicator
- `floe-app/src/features/conversations/OperatorConversations.tsx` — unified operator conversation lifecycle, discovery, and Needs you/Recent grouping
- `floe-app/src/app/layout/LeftNav.tsx` — compact operator health status and recovery action
- `POST /v1/contexts/:id/participants` — join a context (`addContextParticipant`)
- `GET /v1/events?context_id=…&type=message&direction=backward` — newest-first bounded message history with earlier-page cursors (`listContextEventHistoryPage`)
- `POST /v1/workspaces/:ws/contexts` — create a context (`createContext` / `createDirectContext`)
- Bus WebSocket `GET /v1/events/stream` — live updates, `delivery_bundle_available` / turn-end signals drive the working indicator
